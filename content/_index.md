It should be no secret that all three of us consider ourselves huge "Potterheads". We have all read and loved the books multiple times. Thus for us, the reasoning behind starting this project was quite simple: We wanted to work with something we were passionate about and had some degree of expert knowledge in. Choosing this dataset, enabled us to work with more advanced network and text analysis techniques, such as temporal analysis of networks and wordclouds and sentiment analysis. By choosing this dataset we have proposed the following research questions:
- [How do the Harry Potter books change over time?](#how-do-the-books-change-over-time)
- [How do the characters, their interactions / relationships, and language surrounding them change throughout key moments in the Harry Potter books?](#how-do-the-characters-their-interactions--relationships-and-language-surrounding-them-change-throughout-key-moments-in-the-harry-potter-books)

# HOW DO THE BOOKS CHANGE OVER TIME?

 The Harry Potter books where written by J.K. Rowling and initially published between 26th June 1997 â€“ 21st July 2007. The first book (Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone) was originally marketed as a kids-book, but as the next 6 books were published in a span of 10 years, the primary audience of the books grew up. We thus wanted to understand if the topics discussed in the books over time became more complex and more adult.

# HOW DO THE CHARACTERS, THEIR INTERACTIONS / RELATIONSHIPS, AND LANGUAGE SURROUNDING THEM CHANGE THROUGHOUT KEY MOMENTS IN THE HARRY POTTER BOOKS?

It is no secret that what makes a book or series of book exciting to read are its shocking and exciting key moments, where big changes in character arcs happen. We thus wanted to understand how the characters, their interactions and the language surrounding them changed throughout some identified key moments in the Hary Potter books. Learn more about how we explored the moments on their respective pages in the links below:

- [The Muggle world vs. the Wizarding world](/mvw): This is a key moment in Harry's life, as his world is flipped upside down. He goes from an abusive boring world, to a magical one where he is famous and finds meaning. From our analysis the switch from the muggle world to the wizarding world is quite visible. The wizarding world is very central to the Harry Potter books. From researching this key moment it is clear that not only is there a significant increase in characters introduced, but also that Harry Potter switches from the Dursley community to the wizarding community. This also shows a turning point for the character 

- [The establishment of Dumbledore's Army](/da): In the fifth book, Harry, Ron, Hermione and other Hogwards pupils establish Dumbledore's Army, a secret organisation that teaches students defensive spells to protect themselves against the dark arts as an answer to the reign of terror under the new headmistress Dolores Umbridge. This moment leads to a large change in character dynamics. This results in the story centering around the army and the group of characters within it. It is also evident that many characters that appear before the formation of the army no longer appear after the formation.

- [Snape's True allegiance](/sa): In the ending of book 6, Severus Snape goes on to kill Albus Dumbledore. This is a huge shock to the reader, as Snape has been portrayed as a good guy (if not suspicious) throughout the entire series. However in book 7, it is later revealed that Snape was in fact a double agent, and was working for Dumbledore all along. From this we ...

In summary, we found that not only are these moments central to the story from a narative perspective it is also reflected in the network strucures and language surrounding the characters.
