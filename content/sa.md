Key moment: Snape reveals his true allegiance

The climax of the 6th book ends with Snape killing professor Dumbledore in a heated moment that proves to Harry that Snape was indeed on Voldemorts side. However, as it turns out, Snape was actually working for Dumbledore the entire time, and proved to be a double agent. He and Dumbledore had secretly arranged for this happening, as this was the only way they could win over Voldemorts trust. As experts we know this, however we want to explore how this is reflected in the character interactions. When using interactions from the 7th book of the series we get the following character networks before and after the reveal of Snapes true allegiance:

Here it is evident that Snape appears in the same community as the Deatheaters and Voldemort in the chapters leading up to the reveal. However, after the reveal he appears in the same community as Harry, Dumbledore, Lilly and many of the other characters who are mainly opposing Voldemort.

Exploring this in the community distributions as seen below:

Here a large part of the difference between the community distributions is attributed to the fact that there are few chapters left after the reveal. This means that only few characters actually appear in these chapters. However due to the network being so small in the last chapters, it may be more interesting to look at the text analysis for these chapters.
