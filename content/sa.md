title: Snape's True Allegiance
prev: da
---

The climax of the 6th book ends with Snape killing professor Dumbledore in a heated moment that proves to Harry that Snape was indeed on Voldemorts side. However, as it turns out, Snape was actually working for Dumbledore the entire time, and proved to be a double agent. He and Dumbledore had secretly arranged for this happening, as this was the only way they could win over Voldemorts trust. As experts we know this, however we want to explore how this is reflected in the character interactions and text.

From the wordclouds, we notice that Snape's wordclouds shift from being a rather empty set of neutral words, to a significant wordcloud filled with both very negative and positive words such as "dark" and "die", but also "playground" and "eyes" (referencing Lily's eyes). This goes to show that Snape evolves from being a very mysterious character, that little is known about, to a very diverse and complicated character that is both good and evil at the same time.

Looking at Voldemort's word clouds in the two moments, they appear some similarities at first glance with words like "kill", however they are mostly different. When applying expert knowledge to these two moments we realize that Voldemort is mostly talked about due to his ability to "penetrate" Harry's mind. However in the later chapters we can see that Harry realizes that Voldemorts soul is fragmented with words like, "soul", "fragment","connection" and even "collapsing". This tonal shift highlights the fact that Snape's sacrifice helps Harry realize that Voldemort is in fact stoppable.

Another interesting point is that the wordclouds for Harry Potter and Dumbledore are very similar in book 6, chapter 26. Suggesting their close link, as they at this point in time made it back from the Crystal Cave after looking for one of Voldemort's Horcruxes. We however also notice that their wordclouds are equally similar in book 7, chapter 33, explained by harry potter envisioning the memory of snape trough his tears. Understanding how Snape and Dumbledore the entire time has been working plotting and adjusting the harry's journey to defeat Voldemort.

From the sentiment analysis plot above, it is evident that Snape ends book 6 on a very negative note. Throughout the 7th book we see that he only appears in some of the chapters, and when he does, his sentiment is not very consistent. It is also clear however, that towards the end of book 7 Snape's sentiment rises, at the same pace as Harry's does. This is probably due to Harry seeing Snape's memory and getting a closer glimpse into how much Snape has cared and loved for Harry and his parents legacy. Despite his distance, Snape has always been on Harry's side. For Harry, who is the only one experiencing this scene, this creates a lot of positive language regarding Snape, as he understands Snape's true motives. It however, also translates to more positive sentiment towards Harry himself, as he realizes that he is loved by more people than he knew.

When using interactions from the 6th and 7th book of the series we get the following character networks before and after the reveal of Snapes true allegiance:

Here it is evident that Snape in the chapters 20-25 apear allong side Draco Malfoy and the Death Eaters, while in the chapters 26-30 he is allong side Harry Potter, Dumbledore and Malfoy which are all present in the tower when Dumbledore is killed.

In the first 1-32 chapters of book 7. Snape is in the same community as Lord Voldemort and the Death Eaters, while in the last 33-37 chapters he is in the same community as Harry Potter, Albus Dombledore and Lord Voldmort.

In conclusion it is evident that the text and networks indicate that Snape switches between good and evil multiple times during the final two books of the series. We also see from the word clouds that in the chapter where Snape reveals his true allegiance to Harry, it increases his sentiment, thus putting him in a brighter light. It is also apparent from his associated word clouds that the sequence helps de-mystify him as a character.

<!-- Here a large part of the difference between the community distributions is attributed to the fact that there are few chapters left after the reveal. This means that only few characters actually appear in these chapters. However due to the network being so small in the last chapters, it may be more interesting to look at the text analysis for these chapters.
