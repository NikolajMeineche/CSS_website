This world has all sorts of amazing creatures and people. However, the Wizarding World is special due to the fact that it is set to take place parallel to our own world. Therefore it is of interest to see how Harry connects with people before the Wizarding World has been established in the books, in contrast to after it has been introduced. Therefore we have looked at chapter 1-4 in Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone, as well as the collective network of the first 17 chapters of the first book.</p><p>Beneath you can see a visualization of the graphs:</p><iframe src=../images/MugglesvWizards/Network.html style=width:100%;height:700px></iframe><p>Here it is evident that not only is the second network way larger, but there are also more communities surrounding Harry. The Dursley community that is domimant in the first network looks tiny compared to the network of wizards in the second. The vast amount of characters and interconnectons help build this world up from a readers point of view.</p><p>Looking a bit more into these two networks, we have compared the communities of the two networks</p><table><thead><tr><th style=text-align:center>Distribution of size of communities</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img src=../images/MugglesvWizards/community_distribution.png alt></td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:center>Matrix that shows community change</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:center><img src=../images/MugglesvWizards/community_change_matrix.png alt></td></tr></tbody></table><p>From the community change matrix we get three key observations: First of all community 1 does not change after the first 4 chapters up until chapter 17, which is probably due to community 1 consisting of characters such as Arabella Figg, Mr Paws, Snowy, Tufty, and Gordon, which are all relatively unknown characters in the Harry Potter universe that are probably not mentioned from the rest of the chapters.</p><p>Secondly, the characters from network 0 in chapter 1-4 go from being in a single community to being spread across 5 different communities, this makes sense since the characters include Albus Dumbledore, Minerva McGonagall, Rubeus Hagrid, Lily Potter, and James Potter, which are all magical people. In the first 4 chapters the magical world is very one dimensional, but as the magical world is revealed these characters are split into many sub-communities of the Wizarding World, which explains the scattering.</p><p>Thirdly, community 2 is quite untouched by the chapters, except for a few characters. This is because the network includes the Dursleys along with Harry Potter, since he spends his time in the beginning with these characters. However as the Wizarding World is introduced, the connection between the other wizard characters becomes stronger and thus he swaps community.</p><p>(HER KAN VI INKLUDERE DET VIGTIGSTE ORD FRA HVER COMMUNITY)</p><hr class="border-b-2 border-gray-400 mt-8 mx-4"><p>Looking at the degree distributions below we see that there are a couple of central characters, namely Vernon Dursley and Harry Potter, that have high degrees compared to the rest of the characters in the first chapters. However when looking at chapters 1-17 we almost see a straight line in the log-log scale, indicating something close to a heavy tailed distribution, meaning that some of the characters, make up for the majority of edge connections. This is also without considering weighting of edges, which would probably skew the distribution even more.</p><p>(FAKTA TJEK DETTE AFSNIT)
Looking at the degree assortativity matrix we can also see that in both networks, there seems to be a tendency for higher values away from the diagonal of the matrix(except for a few cases, which are more prevalent in chapters 1-4). This intuitively means that characters with many connections tend to interact with characters without many connections. And vice versa if many values lie close to the diagonal, central characters will probably interact with other central characters allowing to grasp which characters that are more important to the story. By looking at the matrix we can see that the latter is only the case in few instances. Therefore it can be concluded that the main characters, like Harry, tend to interact with many side characters in both the early and later chapters. This makes sense given the large amount of side characters, that only get few mentions throughout the book.</p><table><thead><tr><th style=text-align:center>Distribution of degree of communities</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><img src=../images/MugglesvWizards/Degree%20distribution.png alt></td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:center>Matrix that shows the degree assortativity between characters.</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:center><img src=../images/MugglesvWizards/degree%20assortativity%20matrix.png alt></td></tr></tbody></table><hr class="border-b-2 border-gray-400 mt-8 mx-4"><p>Finally we can look at the modularity where we compare it with the average modularity of a random network. Here it can be seen that both networks are more modular than the average random network, however the network becomes less modular with more chapters, which indicate that characters interact more and more often across the different groups in the network.
<img src=../images/MugglesvWizards/modularity%20graphs.png alt></p><hr class="border-b-2 border-gray-400 mt-30 mx0"><p>In conclusion there seems to be a large change between the characters before and after the Wizarding World is introduced. This makes sense as a large part of the story and characters take place in here, and as more characters are introduced, the more intricate the network of characters will be.</p><hr class="border-b-2 border-gray-400 mt-8 mx-4"><div class="font-sans flex justify-between content-center px-4 pb-12"><div class=text-left><p><a href=../temporal%20analysis class="break-normal text-base md:text-sm text-green-500 font-bold no-underline hover:underline">&lt;
