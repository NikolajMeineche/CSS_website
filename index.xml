We have also used the full character list along with each character&amp;rsquo;s associated aliases from the Harry Potter fandom wiki. From this we have created an expanding network that adds characters as nodes and character co-occurences as edges between characters. This way we have analysed both the expanding cumulative network, as well as dived into specific chapters to further investigate.</description></item><item><title>Dumbledore's Army</title><link>https://NikolajMeineche.github.io/CSS_website/da/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://NikolajMeineche.github.io/CSS_website/da/</guid><description>An interesting moment in the Harry Potter books is the formation of Dumbedore&amp;rsquo;s Army, witch is event intuitively shouldh from a character perspective forms a lot of bonds between characters that weren&amp;rsquo;t closely connected before. This means that a large amount of edges should be made, after the formation of the army. As well as this, some of the students also team up with professors and janitors in the form of the Inquisitorial Squad.</description></item><item><title>Snape's True Allegiance</title><link>https://NikolajMeineche.github.io/CSS_website/sa/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://NikolajMeineche.github.io/CSS_website/sa/</guid><description>Key moment: Snape reveals his true allegiance

However, as it turns out, Snape was actually working for Dumbledore the entire time, and proved to be a double agent. He and Dumbledore had secretly arranged for this happening, as this was the only way they could win over Voldemorts trust.</description></item><item><title>Temporal Analysis</title><link>https://NikolajMeineche.github.io/CSS_website/temporal-analysis/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://NikolajMeineche.github.io/CSS_website/temporal-analysis/</guid><description>In the history of harry potter books, there are 7 books.

This world has all sorts of amazing creatures and people. However, the Wizarding World is special due to the fact that it is set to take place parallel to our own world. Therefore it is of interest to see how Harry connects with people before the Wizarding World has been established in the books, in contrast to after it has been introduced.</description></item></channel></rss>
